Please write me as few and effective UNIT tests as possible for isLength.js
file in this isLength.AItest.js file and aime to cover:
    100% line coverage
    100% branch coverage
    100% multiple condition coverage

Please write the tests approximately in this format shown as example:
describe('isLengthAI', () => {
    it('<very short description of first test>', () => {
        expect(isLength(<parameter>)).to.equal(<parameter>);
    });

    it('<very short description of second test>', () => {
        expect(isLength(<parameter>)).to.equal(<parameter>);
    });
});

Please come up with the parameters to test by doing equivalent and boundary
analysis.
