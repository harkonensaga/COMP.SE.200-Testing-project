Please write me as few and effective UNIT tests as possible for <functionName>.js
file in this <functionName>AI.test.js file and aime to cover:
    100% line coverage
    100% branch coverage
    100% multiple condition coverage

Please write the tests approximately in this format shown as example:
describe('<functionName>AI', () => {
    it('<very short description of first test>', () => {
        expect(<functionName>(<parameter>)).to.equal(<parameter>);
    });

    it('<very short description of second test>', () => {
        expect(<functionName>(<parameter>)).to.equal(<parameter>);
    });
});

Please come up with the parameters to test by doing equivalent and boundary
analysis.
